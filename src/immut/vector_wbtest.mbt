/// Tests the conversion of a vector to both column and row matrix
/// representations.
///
/// This test verifies that:
///
/// 1. `to_col_matrix()` converts a vector into a column matrix where each
/// element becomes a row in a single column
/// 2. `to_row_matrix()` converts a vector into a row matrix where all elements
/// are arranged in a single row
///
/// The test uses a 3-element vector `[1, 2, 3]` and checks:
///
/// * Column matrix conversion results in a 3×1 matrix with values stacked
///   vertically
/// * Row matrix conversion results in a 1×3 matrix with values arranged
///   horizontally
///
/// Example:
///
/// ```moonbit
/// let v = Vector::from_array([1, 2, 3])
///
/// let col = v.to_col_matrix() // 3×1 matrix: [[1], [2], [3]]
///
/// let row = v.to_row_matrix() // 1×3 matrix: [[1, 2, 3]]
/// ```
